%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   LATEX COMPILATION SAFETY RULES (MANDATORY)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   The generated document MUST compile without errors or warnings.
%   The following rules are strictly enforced during content generation.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   TABLE AND ALIGNMENT SAFETY
%
%   1. SPECIAL CHARACTER ESCAPING
%      The following characters MUST be escaped when used as text:
%
%         &   → \&
%         %   → \%
%         _   → \_
%         #   → \#
%         $   → \$
%
%      These characters are reserved by LaTeX and MUST NEVER appear
%      unescaped inside tables, captions, or normal text.
%
%   2. COLUMN ALIGNMENT RULE
%      The number of '&' separators in each table row MUST EXACTLY match
%      the column definition of the tabular/tabularx environment.
%
%      Example:
%          {lX}  → exactly ONE '&' per row.
%          {cXX} → exactly TWO '&' per row.
%
%      Extra or missing '&' characters are strictly prohibited.
%
%   3. ROW TERMINATION
%      Every table row MUST end with:
%
%          \\
%
%      before any \hline, \midrule, or \bottomrule command.
%
%   4. LONG TEXT IN TABLE CELLS
%      Long paragraphs inside tables MUST be wrapped using:
%
%          \parbox[t]{\linewidth}{...}
%
%      or allowed to flow only within X-type columns of tabularx.
%      Plain long text must not overflow alignment.
%
%   5. NO EMPTY TABLE ROWS
%      Blank rows or incomplete rows inside tables are not allowed.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   BOOKTABS USAGE RULES
%
%   6. When using \toprule, \midrule, or \bottomrule:
%         - Do NOT combine them with vertical lines.
%         - Do NOT place text immediately after rule commands.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   ENVIRONMENT INTEGRITY
%
%   7. Every environment MUST close properly:
%
%          \begin{tabularx} → \end{tabularx}
%          \begin{table}    → \end{table}
%          \begin{figure}   → \end{figure}
%
%      Nested environments must close in reverse order.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   CONTENT SAFETY RULES
%
%   8. Do NOT introduce additional LaTeX packages.
%   9. Do NOT modify column definitions.
%  10. Do NOT insert raw line breaks or manual spacing commands inside tables.
%  11. Do NOT include emojis or Unicode symbols unsupported by LaTeX.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   VALIDATION REQUIREMENT
%
%   12. Before output, the document must be internally validated to ensure:
%       - No alignment mismatches exist.
%       - No unescaped special characters remain.
%       - All tables compile cleanly.
